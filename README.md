# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
This repository contains a simple logistic regression model for predicting whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant. The model is trained using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Steps:
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned dataset and performed train-test split.
Excluded the sample code number as it was deemed irrelevant.
Model Training:

Trained a logistic regression model using scikit-learn.
Prediction:

Utilized the trained model to predict tumor types.
Evaluation:

Evaluated model performance using a confusion matrix and k-fold cross-validation.
Feel free to explore the code and contribute!
